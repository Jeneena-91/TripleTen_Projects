# Megaline Telecom Plan Analysis
## Project Overview
This data science project analyzes two prepaid mobile plans offered by the telecom operator Megaline — the Surf and Ultimate plans. The objective is to determine which plan generates more revenue, in order to guide the company’s advertising budget allocations. Using data on 500 clients, the analysis focuses on customer behavior, usage patterns, and revenue contributions of each plan.

## Project Structure
- Data Initialization and Loading:  Load and explore the data for structure, completeness, and initial insights.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data, handling missing values and converting data types for analysis.
- Behavioral Analysis: Examine customer usage patterns — number of calls, text messages, and data usage — across both plans.
- Hypothesis Testing: Use statistical methods to determine if there is a significant difference in revenue between the Surf and Ultimate plans.
## Key Findings
- Plan Distribution: 68% of the 500 customers use the Surf plan.
- Usage Behavior:
          - Users on the Ultimate plan typically remain within their plan limits.
          - Surf plan users often exceed their included services (calls, messages, and data), incurring additional charges.
- Revenue Insight: The Surf plan generates more revenue due to extra charges when users exceed the plan limits.
- Recommendation:The Surf plan should receive more advertising investment, as it contributes more to revenue despite having more varied user behavior.

 ## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- SciPy/Statsmodels for hypothesis testing
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

## Conclusion
This analysis provided actionable insights into customer behavior and revenue trends for the Megaline telecom company. It is recommended that the Surf plan be prioritized in future marketing strategies, as it shows higher revenue potential due to overage charges.
