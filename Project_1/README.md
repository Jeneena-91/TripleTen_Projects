# IMDb TV Shows Analysis: The Golden Age of Television

## Project Overview

This project explores data from the entertainment industry, specifically focusing on TV shows during the "Golden Age" of television — a period that began in 1999 with the release of *The Sopranos* and continues today. Our goal was to test the assumption:

> **"Highly-rated shows released during the Golden Age also receive the most IMDb user votes."**

As a data professional, the task was to validate or refute this assumption using real-world data.

## Data & Methodology

- **Data Source**: IMDb dataset with titles, types, ratings, and number of votes
- **Scope**: TV shows only (movies were excluded)
- **Time Frame**: 1999 to present
- **Analysis Performed**:
  - Filtering by show type and release date
  - Grouping by rating scores
  - Comparing number of votes across rating groups

## Key Findings

The data confirms the initial assumption:  
**Highly-rated shows from the Golden Age tend to receive the most user votes.**

While shows with a rating of 4 had more votes than those rated 5 and 6, the **top-rated shows (ratings 7–9)** consistently had the **highest number of votes** overall.

The analysis covered **approximately 94% of the original dataset**, providing a strong level of confidence in the results.
