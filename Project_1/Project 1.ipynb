You will study a dataset with records on movies and shows. The research will focus on the \"Golden Age\" of television, which began in 1999 with the release of *The Sopranos* and is still ongoing.\n\nThe aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows (we will focus on TV shows, ignoring movies) released during the \"Golden Age\" of television also have the most votes.\n\n### Stages \nData on movies and shows is stored in the `/datasets/movies_and_shows.csv` file. There is no information about the quality of the data, so you will need to explore it before doing the analysis.\n\nFirst, you'll evaluate the quality of the data and see whether its issues are significant. Then, during data preprocessing, you will try to account for the most critical problems.\n \nYour project will consist of three stages:\n 1. Data overview\n 2. Data preprocessing\n 3.
